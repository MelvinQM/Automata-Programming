## De 2D Array and the fsaExec Method
What the code does is it receives an input in the form of a string then it takes the ASCII
values of each char and uses these to go through the states starting at default state 0 the boolean array basically says
that if you end on state 3 you are provided with a true.

To call a 2D array you need to fill in both indexes [a][b]
'a' stands for which group you want to select from 'b'
stands for which value you want from this group.

### Aantekeningen "IN PARTIAL DUTCH"
- **CPU** = State machine
- **Memory/Registers** = State
- **Instruction/Cycle** = Transition

Complex applications can be designed and documented with
- UML state diagrams
- Java object has a value (state)
- Java method....

DEA = In elke staat alle inputs gedefinieerd (deterministic)    
NEA = Niet gedefineerde of dubbele overgangen toegestaan

NEA kost meestal minder werk.
